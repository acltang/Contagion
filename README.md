# Contagion
Repository for CSS458 Contagion 
This program was developed for our CSS458 final project. 

Contagion is an agent based simulation for modeling rats and other contagion carriers in various environments.

The model uses real world values obtained from data of previous plague outbreaks, namely the Black Death.

The user will be able to modify various parameters of the model to simulate different previous events or 
to test various areas and possible agents to create countermeasures.

Simulation is run through model.py.
